R program to analyze the Statscannabis crowdsourcing database
On January 25, 2018 Statistics Canada began collecting information about cannabis prices in Canada using a crowdsourcing application. Canadians are encouraged to enter information anonymously about the prices, quantities and other characteristics of their individual cannabis transactions, whether those transactions are legal or illegal. Roughly once a month Statistics Canada posts a CSV file with all of the data submitted so far. As of May 2018 over 19,000 Canadians had sub mitted transaction data.
